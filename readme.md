"Alien Project"

Our first project at Ada tech school was to develop a game on PICO-8, a fantasy video game console that mimics the limited graphical and sound capabilities of 8-bit systems of the 1980s.

This game is a brick breaker.The alien is the ball and the astronauts are the bricks. 

To play our game :

  - if PICO-8 is installed on your computer, clone the repo in your file pico8/carts. Load the file in PICO-8, enter "cd alienproject" in the terminal and then "load alienproject.p8"
  - if not, you can visit this link : https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=120898#p
